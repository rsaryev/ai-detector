# ðŸ§  AI Detector

AI Detector is a command-line tool designed to analyze code and determine the likelihood that it was generated by an AI model. It leverages the power of OpenAI's API to evaluate code samples. Currently, the tool uses a general-purpose model, but it's expected that a specialized model for detecting AI-generated code will be introduced in the future, which will enhance the accuracy of the tool.

## Usage

```bash
npx ai-detector [options]
or 
bunx ai-detector [options]
```

```bash
Options:
